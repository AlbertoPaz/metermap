{"name":"MeterMap","tagline":"Maps clauses from a text corpus onto the metrical structure of a poem","body":"The software works by parsing every clause and sentence in the input corpus for meter using [the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict), parsing every line in the poem, and then finding clauses from the input corpus that match the meter of each line in the poem.\r\n\r\nUsing the [Pattern](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern) library's sentiment analysis tool, clauses can be selected based on sentiment to create moody negative poems, uplifting positive ones, or anything in between. You can even cycle back and forth between positive and negative sentiment.\r\n\r\nRhyming tools are included as well, although that part of the software especially remains a work in progress. If you have ideas for improvements, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:ross.goodwin@gmail.com).\r\n\r\nThe software works best with a large text corpus to draw clauses from. (For example, the included file, `dickens.txt`, contains the complete works of Charles Dickens.)\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2015  Ross Goodwin\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

    It's quite chilly this morning,\r\n\t      Wind-gnawed face and bleak,\r\n\t                I know I damn well hate you.\r\n\t               Destruction or grief or anguish:\r\n\t       For evil to come from evil.\r\n\t   The limp hard hand merely withdrew from his,\r\n\t It was no more deadly; that was impossible.\r\n\t                                      Outraged,\r\n\t            As dull and uneventful as ever.\r\n\t                 Perhaps he knew no better anyway,\r\n\t                                   Outraged,\r\n\t     They were disappointed.\r\n\t             On the bowl of the cold cob pipe.\r\n\t             And then I saw that he was trembling,\r\n\tMuttered a shocking phrase.\r\n\t    We happen to know that the man is guilty.\r\n\t                Poor gentlemanly dull Johnny.\r\n\t              But he is afraid of living,\r\n\t                    Outraged,\r\n\t       She's frigid.\r\n\t         I wasn't even mad about that no more.\r\n\tHave sense enough to dive away from the propeller.\r\n\t         She's frigid.\r\n\t          And they was a little impatient with me.\r\n\t             It's that terrible Mr.\r\n\tFlashlights glared and winked along the base.\r\n\r\n### David Foster Wallace + Dr. Seuss\r\n\r\n\tThe mug has a hair-thin brown crack down one side,\r\n\tA skinny dog at his side, half in profile.\r\n\tAccording to Taylor's use of the word can,\r\n\tAnd his thoughts had drifted all over the place,\r\n\tBent over and felt the wet grass with his hand.\r\n\tBut I don't really know anything about it.\r\n\tI'm not sure whether they're called hoofs or feet on swine.\r\n\tHandcuffed to the corpse of his malevolent foe,\r\n\tSince for him it would be at worst somewhat dull.\r\n\tHis legs look like he's about to wet himself.\r\n\tIt seemed like it had to have been a bad sign,\r\n\tOften I was forced to avert my eyes from him,\r\n\tSo fiercely as to incline us to say 'false.'\r\n\tAccording to Taylor's use of the word can,\r\n\tBut I don't really know anything about it.\r\n\tThe kind you have to convert and cook up yourself,\r\n\tIs identical to those worst dreams' form itself:\r\n\tWould refute fatalism with respect to the past,\r\n\tOr between false and self-contradictory ones,\r\n\tHe spoke very little, just sat up with me.\r\n\tThe bad ankle hasn't ached once this whole year.\r\n\tThe mist of the pool's too-clean smell is in your eyes;\r\n\tThis is awful news.'\r\n\tInstead of getting sick,\r\n\tNeeds something to make himself dark, in the game.\r\n\tBut that's not what I mean by driving the scene.\r\n\tFeminine past participle of dare,\r\n\tThat either Q or Q must fail to occur.\r\n\tWould refute fatalism with respect to the past,\r\n\tTaylor has not engaged in linguistic reform.\r\n\tHe kept asking them what they were afraid of.\r\n\tFor just three weeks' rental of anything foreign.\r\n\tThough it's hard to figure out just what they're doing,\r\n\tAnd the burly guys manning the road's barricades.\r\n\tThat either Q or Q must fail to occur.\r\n\tHe'd mentioned the child-actor's name over and over.\r\n\tThe sort of man who stands in one place all day.\r\n\tBut born in the hated-by-you Ottawa,\r\n\tYou are merely going with some cosmic flow.\r\n\tYou are merely going with some cosmic flow.\r\n\tHe talks on the phone at the office a lot.\r\n\tHe spoke very little, just sat up with me.\r\n\tHis police lock protruding into empty air,\r\n\tMutton stuffed with foie gras, double chocolate rum cake.\r\n\tWhat matters, alas, is what this eros wrought.\r\n\tHe kept asking them what they were afraid of.\r\n\tIt seemed like it had to have been a bad sign,\r\n\tYou just sit there and listen as hard as you can,\r\n\tI wouldn't want to go overboard with this thing,\r\n\tThe whine of no real sleep for maybe five days,\r\n\tI could tell just by looking you weren't happy.\r\n\tCan we talk about it before you react?\r\n\tShe's coming to Cleveland next Friday, it says.\r\n\tIt's just before serious harvesting starts,\r\n\tIs there anything to say on this subject?\r\n\tWhich at this age isn't that far behind them.'\r\n\tThough it's hard to figure out just what they're doing,\r\n\tYou can tell it's spooky down here in the summer,\r\n\tThe chasm he opened between her and I.\r\n\tYou don't want her facial reaction described.\r\n\tHe spoke very little, just sat up with me.\r\n\tAnd it rolls down the floor of the subway,\r\n\tThe dead fields' total snow like a well-ironed sheet,\r\n\tThe sense is ever so slightly sad.\r\n\tBecause I allegedly have a disease?\r\n\tBecause I allegedly have a disease?\r\n\tI don't really drink alcoholic stuff much,\r\n\tWe've been at it maybe an hour and half,\r\n\tI go Fucking hang up on me why don't you,\r\n\tAnd apologized for interrupting his work,\r\n\tHard dangerous spirals of brittle black hair.\r\n\r\n### Charles Dickens + a sonnet\r\n\r\n\tThe awful mountain-voices died away,\r\n\tThe awful thinness of the fallen man,\r\n\tThe perpetrator of the bloody smear,\r\n\tBefore the Chicken's penetrating glance,\r\n\tAnd not in an exaggerated form,\r\n\tAdjusting it upon a dusty clock,\r\n\tAnd travelled slowly up a steep ascent.\r\n\tWithout abatement of her awful stock,\r\n\tAnd draw the placid veil before her clear,\r\n\tIn their unhealthy looks and feeble sight,\r\n\tAnd indicating nothing but the four,\r\n\tAnd keeps a wary eye upon the four.\r\n\tBehind protruding angles of the four,\r\n\tAnd with her secret weighing on her bright.","google":"UA-50113889-14","note":"Don't delete this file!
